# Password-Generator
A Random Password Generator

The objective of this homework was to use javascript to create a functional webpage that can be used to generate a random password. When clicking on the "Generate Password" button, the window will prompt the user to enter or confirm certain criteria that the user wants in their final password. The user must select at least 1 of the prompts for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special character and must choose a password length of 8-128 character long; otherwise, a message will appear on the window to alert the user. The generated password will then appear in the middle box of the webpage.

- focused on using if statements to get the criteria selection
- focused on using for loop and Math to create an array for the final password
